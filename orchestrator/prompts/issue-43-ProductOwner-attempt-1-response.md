  "question": "Is IGitHubClient part of a public API or distributed NuGet package consumed by external projects where removing these methods would be a breaking change?",
  "answer": "I cannot determine from the provided information whether IGitHubClient is part of a public API or distributed NuGet package. If it is published and consumed externally, removing methods would be a breaking change; if it is only used internally within this repository, removing them is safe per the acceptance criteria.",
  "reasoning": "CANNOT_ANSWER: the story and files listed show IGitHubClient lives under src/Orchestrator.App and that the two methods are unused internally, but they do not state whether the assembly is packaged/published or consumed by external projects. To be certain, check the repository for: 1) any NuGet packaging config (nuspec, PackageReference with Version/publish steps, dotnet pack in CI), 2) CI/CD pipeline steps that publish a package, 3) other repositories or solutions that reference this package (internal package feed or public), 4) public API docs or README stating consumers, and 5) the assembly's access modifiers (is the interface public). If any external consumers exist, treat this as a breaking change and follow a deprecation policy (mark obsolete first or bump major version). If no external consumers, proceed with the minimal removal as specified."
